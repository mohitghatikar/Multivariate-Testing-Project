# Multivariate-Testing-Project

Temple Run is one of the most iconic games in the modern smartphone era. It has been downloaded over a billion times till date 
on both Android and iPhone devices. Our objective in this experiment is to determine factors that impact the final score. Besides 
applying experimental design principles on a real world gaming application, we also hope that this experience will be 
useful in dealing with other business problems especially in the area of marketing.
